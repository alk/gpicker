;;; Commentary
;;
;; Arrange loading of this file. One way is to add
;;
;;   (load "/usr/local/share/gpicker/gpicker.el")
;;
;; to your .emacs
;;
;; Run `gpicker-visit-project' to specify project directory.
;;
;; Open files by running `gpicker-find-file' or
;; `gpicker-find-file-other-window' or
;; `gpicker-find-file-other-frame'.
;;
;; I prefer to globally bind them to Super-f, C-x 4 Super-f and
;; C-x 5 Super-f correspondingly. You can do same by adding the following
;; elisp snippet to your .emacs
;;
;;   (global-set-key [8388710] 'gpicker-find-file)
;;   (global-set-key [?\C-x ?4 8388710] 'gpicker-find-file-other-window)
;;   (global-set-key [?\C-x ?5 8388710] 'gpicker-find-file-other-frame)
;;
;; or
;;
;;   (global-set-key (kbd "s-f") 'gpicker-find-file)
;;   (global-set-key (kbd "C-x 4 s-f") 'gpicker-find-file-other-window)
;;   (global-set-key (kbd "C-x 5 s-f") 'gpicker-find-file-other-frame)
;;
;; On most keyboards Super is a key with flag between Ctrl and Alt. On
;; mac keyboards it's Command key.
