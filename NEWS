gpicker NEWS -- history of user-visible changes.
Sat, 02 Jan 2010 20:57:04 +0200

* gpicker.el doesn't hide gpicker-errors.log from user and unlinks it after gpicker
  invocation

* gpicker became even more faster. As part of performance work gpicker
  has been changed to truncate result list to 1000 items. Any gpicker
  optimizations would be invisible without that, as gtk+ list model
  isn't too fast. After more than year of using this feature I've
  never seen that truncated end of list. So it works great in
  practice.

* gpicker now filters & sorts results in separate thread. It
  gracefully abort current filtration when pattern is changed before
  filtration completion. This made UI extremely responsive, especially
  on huge filesets. I've tested this on list of my entire filesystem
  with more than 1M of files.

* Sergey Avseyev contributed VIM integration

* Sergey Avseyev contributed project types support for mercurial and
  bazaar. New project type 'guess' automagically detects project
  type.

* gpicker now has (out-of-tree) integrations with netbeans (by Sergey
  Avseyev) and gedit (by Yura Tolstik). See
  http://github.com/avsej/gpicker-netbeans and
  http://github.com/yltsrc/gedit-gpicker respectively.

* gpicker can now read names from stdin which enables it's use for
  choosing not just files, but anything.
  http://github.com/alk/supermegadoc uses this feature to pick index
  items (functions, types, ...) from various documentation systems.

* gpicker now has command-line options that control directory
  separator and name separator, as well as few other options that
  control name list loading.

  Directory separator option along with ability to read arbitrary
  names from stdin abstracts gpicker's notion of directory path to
  more general notion of namespace. In particular supermegadoc package
  uses erlang module name as namespace when navigating erlang
  documentation.

  Current version supports only single-char separators, yet. And
  there's special support for specifying new-line, zero byte, etc.

* gpicker (and it's Emacs integration) now supports multi-select. It
  is now possible to open .c and .h with one gpicker invocation. Emacs
  integration will automatically use split frame in that case.

* it's now possible to specify initial pattern. Emacs integration now
  uses word around point as initial pattern.

* gpicker file-list loading has been moved into separate thread, which
  allows gpicker UI to be responsive during file-list loading. You can
  now exit gpicker at any time.

* gpicker now supports building with (now obsolete) gtk-osx
  2.14. http://gtk-osx.org doesn't ship that gtk bundle anymore. But
  (possibly with minor ./configure.ac tweaks) it should build with
  latest gtk versions on OSX.

* it is now possible to control 'find' command line that gpicker uses to
  load list of files via GPICKER_FIND environment variable.

* WARNING: gpicker.el is not automagically installed anymore. Be
  careful to manually copy gpicker.el into correct place when
  installing or upgrading.

* Emacs integration now includes names of non-file backed buffers to
  select list and allows switching to them.

* gpicker now includes gpicker-simple which is non-interactive version
  of gpicker. Most importantly, gpicker-simple doesn't have any build
  dependencies.

  In default './configure' build gpicker-simple is just a hardlink to
  gpicker. But see Makefile.simple if you want to build
  dependency-free gpicker-simple. I think it even should be possible
  to build gpicker-simple on windows, with few tweaks (like providing
  missing getopt(3) implementation).

* gpicker.el now has (largely broken) ido integration (that depends
  only on gpicker-simple).

* gpicker now has initial support for matching UTF-8
  names. It is case-sensitive outside of ASCII though.

* gpicker now has manpages
